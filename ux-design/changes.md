### Project Background
The most complicated project I’ve worked on recently is the design and management of an enterprise AI. The several layers of permissions, use cases, and integrations led to creative problem solving, prioritization of features, and intentionality in creating an MVP that allowed for easy adaptation by client companies.

For one component of this project, I designed a web-based accounts manager experience. There were several permission levels including individual employees, company manager, product manager, and superadmin each with specific, and variant accesses. Below is the process I undertook for the first phase of designing and releasing the Admin Web Portal.

Unfortunately, due to NDA, I can’t provide specific information or any documents to support the description, but you can see in more general terms some of my recent products on my [website](https://www.andyvanderlinde.com).

### Process
* My process for establishing a structure for design decisions began with product assessments. For this project, I looked at existing experiences for importing data (ie: Google Maps, Mailchimp) and documentation on best practices for managing permissions within organizations.
* With this information, I sketched several iterations of the wireframes in notebook. (Ideally, if time and budget permit, I would undertake user research and implement findings prior to this stage, however this was not within in the purview of this component of the project.) 
* I present wireframes, data, and best practices to UI designer, development team, and CTO, and discuss strategy. We determined priorities for release and dependencies. Reflecting the estimated lift, and comparing it to time and budget constraints, we narrowed scope to two permissions: Super admin: product manager at product company, and Admin: client company manager. We identified integrations necessary for the project. I coordinated with development team and CTO to provide an update release priorities to client.
* Using Sketch, I created low-fidelity mock-ups, specifying custom branding opportunities for future business adoption, and designing the processes for integrations (ie: Salesforce, Box, Dropbox, Office 365).
* Mock-ups were shared with development team to adjusted design, with feedback from other visual designer. I established filter, search, and edit functionalities, data input requirements and fields, and error handling process.
* Throughout the development phase, I communicated with the team to answer questions, or alter designs to fit unanticipated hurdles discovered during development.
* Development delivered the project in phases, focusing on functionality then designs. At each phase, I tested the deliverables, and finally checked implementation of project against designs. I tested the admin site against AI mobile app to ensure fidelity of data.
* I wrote documentation to support project decision and manual on using the site to share with client for the release MVP to client project manager. I answered the client’s project manager’s design questions, and worked with development to resolve concerns and bugs as needed

### Next Steps
* The next phase of the admin site would be to expand user permission levels and provide access to updating app permissions through the mobile AI app.
* The MVP was being released internally. Feedback and data were informally collected. I would like to use that information, along with more structured user testing to finesse the admin site.
* The nature of the product as a whole encourages customization from company to company, I would design an interaction that would allow admins to create additional types datasets that weren’t necessarily predetermined. The current MVP has tables for employees and contact information, for instance, however designing an option for companies to create tables with individualized tables and providing options for validating that information would be an important next step.
